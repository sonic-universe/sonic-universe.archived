		This is the Sonic Universe RP Server. If you have cool Sonic OCs or want to be the existing characters, this server is the one for you.

		OC Registration and Balancing: Our OC registration system insists of a reference sheet that you must copy and paste. Just fill out the information and submit it. We will have someone check it as soon as possible. If your OC has powers and/or skills that are too OP, we can chat and help you fix it. We always make sure to keep things fair for everyone.
		<br>&nbsp;<br>
		Character Requests: We offer all users a chance to roleplay as their favorite Sonic characters from the games or the Archie Comics. Just pick a character and make a request. If it is available, we will have you do an audition to make sure you can fit the part. If you do good, you get the part. If not, feel free to pick another and try again.
		<br>&nbsp;<br>
		Outside of RP: We offer many forms of entertainment outside of the RP including channels for general chat, art, videos, memes, blogspam, and music players. There will always be something to do.
		<br>&nbsp;<br>
		Suggestions and Concerns: We always take advice from members to make the server better. If you have any ideas or concerns, feel free to let us know.
		<br>&nbsp;<br>
		The server server always works hard to to help the server improve, and opinions from it's members always helps. So feel free to check it out. We'll see you there.
